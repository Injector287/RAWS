# The-Ultimate-Project
Class 12 Computer Science Project 

Hey there,
This is my first proper project that i have worked so seriously on. I made it for my 12th grade Computer Assignment which tests 
your ability in python and mysql, so i decided to integrate them both by using the mysqlconnector module and make a DBMS. It is 
nothing too new, stuff you may have come across especially if you had opted or will opt computer branch in high school. 

So About the project...
This is RAWS(Residential Association Welfare Management System). Its all about making the mundane building association life a
bit more colorful and easier with the help of python. 

The program has a dedicated login module, where you may create your new user. Default is {admin:pass} 
Proceeding forwards, you will come across options to manage
Flat and Residential Details(The houseowner stuff)
Common Association Complaints 
Maintainence(The money matters)

Its as simple as a program can get. There is no gui and it requires MySQL server and python to run. You may need to edit the 
python file for userid and password for the server depending on what you have set it as. If you find difficulty, browse youtube
you will get plenty of tutorials to help you along the way. 

Tag me if you have any queries. Cheers ;)
